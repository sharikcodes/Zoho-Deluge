# Zoho-Deluge

I utilized Deluge scripting in Zoho CRM to implement the following functionalities:

1. Utilized the GetRecords API to retrieve data from the Leads section in Zoho CRM.
2. Implemented functionality to retrieve and attach files to records.
3. Integrated the UpdateRecords API to update records seamlessly with Zoho CRM.
4. Utilized the GetRecordById API for retrieving specific records with Zoho Integration.
5. Implemented record updates seamlessly with Zoho Integration.
